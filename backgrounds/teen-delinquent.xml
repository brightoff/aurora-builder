		<description>
			<p>You are an experienced young troublemaker with a history of breaking the law. You have spent a lot of time among other delinquents such as yourself and have learned to get whatever you want by flouting the rules and regulations of society. Whether your difficult childhood lead you to this path of delinquency, or perhaps just your desire for cheap thrills and petty crime, you may be well on your way to becoming a true criminal. Or, perhaps you may find a way out before you spiral out of control for good. Either way, you've got a bad reputation and the adults in your life don't know what to do with you.</p>

			<h5>SUGGESTED CHARACTERISTICS</h5>
			<p>Delinquents might seem like bad eggs on the surface, but some have an abundance of endearing, if not redeeming, characteristics. Even so, most show absolutely no respect for the rules and especially not for any kind of authority figure.</p>
